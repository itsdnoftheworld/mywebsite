		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Heaven Official&#39;s Blessing/天官赐福</td>
			<td>墨香铜臭</td>
			<td>★★★★★</td>
			<td>Very long (one million word count) Chinese webnovel full of romance, engaging plot, plot twists, and humor.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

			<td>Caitlin Doughty</td>
			<td>★★★★★</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The Guest List</td>
			<td>Lucy Foley</td>
			<td>★★★★</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The Kaleidescope of Death</td>
			<td>
			<p>Xī Zǐx&ugrave;/西子绪</p>
			</td>
			<td>★★★</td>
			<td>Very gory horror novel with a confusing and anticlimatic ending</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Magpie Murders</td>
			<td>Anthony Horowitz</td>
			<td>★★★</td>
			<td>A creative story within a story murder mystery, but ultimately the reveal was lame. Author also seems to have a specific view of gay people.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Moonflower Murders</td>
			<td>Anthony Horowitz</td>
			<td>★★★★</td>
			<td>Although better plotted than its predecessor, the story within a story aspect was lacking. Author again has some fixed ideas about gay people.&nbsp;</td>

			<td>It was just kinda bad and unfunny and inaccurate.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Jack and Lem</td>
			<td>David Pitts</td>

			<td>Although writing isn&#39;t the most engaging, as the owner of a JFK plate, this was interesting look into an important figure in his life not often mentioned in history.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Afterwords: Letters on the Death of Virginia Woolf</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The Sentence is Death</td>
			<td>Anthony Horowitz</td>
			<td>★★★★</td>
			<td>I already forgot the details but I remember being entertained! The author&#39;s bad representation of gay people strikes again.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A Line to Kill</td>
			<td>Anthony Horowitz</td>
			<td>★★★</td>
			<td>I guessed the killer halfway through. No mention of gay people at all this time.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
