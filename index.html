<h1>2021 - A Retrospective</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Dillon Ngo, and I'm a junior marketing student (for now).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For me, 2021 was the year I turned 18, amongst many other important milestones, and as the 2022 approaches, I want to take time and reflect on everything that's happened this year, both in my life and around the world.</p>
